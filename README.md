# Cryptography
This Python project implements a Digital Envelope encryption system that combines asymmetric and symmetric cryptography to securely encrypt and decrypt messages. The system generates RSA key pairs for both the sender and the receiver and uses AES encryption for efficiently encrypting the message content. It then encrypts the AES key and initialization vector (IV) with the receiver’s public RSA key to ensure secure transmission. The encrypted data, including the AES key, IV, and ciphertext, is stored in a specified file format, which can be CSV, TXT, or Pickle.

The core functionality of the system is encapsulated in the Digital Envelope class, which handles key generation, encryption, and decryption processes. The class first generates a pair of RSA keys for both the sender and the receiver. The receiver's private key is saved and loaded for decryption purposes. The system then performs symmetric encryption using AES, where a random AES key and IV are generated for each encryption. The plaintext message is encrypted using AES, and then the AES key and IV are encrypted with the receiver's RSA public key (asymmetric encryption).

The encrypted data is stored in different formats depending on the user's choice: CSV, TXT, or Pickle. In the CSV format, the encrypted AES key and ciphertext are written as hexadecimal values in a comma-separated format. In the TXT format, the encrypted data is saved as hexadecimal strings in a plain text file. In the Pickle format, the encrypted key and ciphertext are serialized as Python objects. When decrypting, the system reads the encrypted data from the chosen file format, decrypts the AES key and IV using the receiver’s private RSA key, and then uses them to decrypt the ciphertext back to the original plaintext message.

The encryption system also supports two modes of AES encryption: CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) and CTR (Counter). The user is prompted to select one of these modes at the beginning of the process. In CBC mode, each plaintext block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before being encrypted. In CTR mode, a stream of key material is generated by encrypting a counter value, which is then used for encryption. These modes offer different cryptographic properties, allowing the user to select the one that best fits their security needs.

To use the system, the user runs the main() function, which guides them through the process of selecting the AES mode, entering the plaintext message, and choosing the file format for saving the encrypted data. After encryption, the message is stored in the selected file format, and the program automatically decrypts it and prints the original message. The system also handles key management by saving and loading the receiver's private key from a PEM file, ensuring that the decryption process is secure and only accessible to the intended recipient.

This Digital Envelope encryption system relies on the cryptography library for cryptographic operations, including RSA, AES, and padding. Additionally, it uses the os library for generating random keys and IVs, and the csv and pickle modules to save the encrypted data. Users can install the necessary dependencies with the command pip install cryptography. By combining the strength of RSA for secure key exchange with the efficiency of AES for data encryption, this system provides a robust solution for securely transmitting and storing sensitive information.
